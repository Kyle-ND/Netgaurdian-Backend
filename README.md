## Contribution Etiquette

Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth workflow:

1. **Create a Branch**
    - Always create a new branch from `dev` for your work.
    - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-login-endpoint`).

2. **Feature Development**
    - For new features, create a new file as needed.
    - When implementing functionality, call functions from the `api.py` file to maintain consistency.

3. **Pull Requests**
    - Once your changes are complete, open a Pull Request (PR) to the `dev` branch.
    - Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.

4. **Code Review**
    - Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.

5. **General Tips**
    - Keep commits small and focused.
    - Follow existing code style and conventions.
